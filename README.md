# ccp-dml
Official Tensorflow Implementation of Deep Metric Learning with Chance Constraints (Chance Constrained Programming for Deep Metric Learning)

# quick info
Implements many dml methods and provides a benchmarking framework.

A detailed guide will be prepared soon.

**framework folder:** metric_learning


# requirements:
tensorflow >= 2.8

yaml, numpy, PIL, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib, imageio, pprint

# instructions:
(1) put custom config files in ./metric_learning/configs

(2) run >python trainModel.py command with arguments within ./metric_learning folder

(2.1) dataset can be passes as an argument

(2.2) dataset is downloaded automatically

(3) different configurations can be experimented by changing related .yaml files
